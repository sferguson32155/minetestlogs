During this development cycle, I made significant progress on the "Mine Test" project. Specifically, I was able to accomplish the following:

Successfully got the main branch working
Switched to the Native API branch
Added a config file that enables client and server testing
However, I also encountered some issues during this development cycle. Specifically, the config file that I added created an issue when attempting to start a new world with the current version (5.4.1). I am currently working to resolve this issue.

Progress:

Loaded development test - Done
Created a simple mod - Not done
Ran server and client tests - Done
Moving forward, I plan to focus on addressing the issues with the config file and completing the creation of the simple mod.
