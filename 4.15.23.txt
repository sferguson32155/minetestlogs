Worked on detaching "l_rollback.cpp" from lua

Can't remove NO_MAP_LOCK_REQUIRED

API_FCT??

Converted ModApiRollback class to nativeModApiRollback class.

Removed unnecessary MAP_LOCK_REQUIRED macro from l_is_started function.

Converted l_rollback_revert_actions_by and l_rollback_get_node_actions functions to n_rollback_revert_actions_by and n_rollback_get_node_actions functions.

Updated function signatures in nativeModApiRollback class to match the new implementations of the functions.
